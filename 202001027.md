## Q2.

### AI hear-aid app has the following:

#### Scope:
- Aim: Our goal is to provide hearing aid by amplifying the sounds which should not be ignored/are immediate alerts.
- Potential issues/hurdles: Differentiating between the day to day noise and immediate alerts. And even after recognizing the alerts, amplifying them without noise is gonna be a hard task.
- Resources needed: Use of AI for alert detection. Smartphone having specifications equivalent to or above the minimum requirements stated.
- Well optimised for low-end as well as high end phones.

#### Features:
- Users should not get a noisy sound i.e. the output should be neat, filtered and amplified.
- Users should be able to customize their app by adding or removing some alerts as per their own convenience.
- Users should be able to set the output volume according to their choice.
- App should run with same efficiency in foreground and background as well.

#### Non-Functional Aspects:
- Security: Altering the settings related to few crucial alert sounds like fire alarm must not be allowed. And app should be safe from trojans and hackers.
- Usability: It should work by using a little space out of RAM and ROM as well so that users do not face problems due to system.
- Accuracy: It should not miss even a single alert sound because that could be dangerous for users and they may stop trusting the app.
- Maintainibility: Making changes to software should be simple and it should be easy to port the app from one device to another with same settings.
- Availability: App should run effectively 24/7 unless user turns it off. If the app crashes/stops working, it must recover in not more than few minutes.
